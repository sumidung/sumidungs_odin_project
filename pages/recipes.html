    <h1>How to make your own bread at home</h1>
    <p><strong>Disclaimer: I am no expert at making sourdough this is the recipe from my first ever selfmade sourdough bread. But since the Odin Project asks you to make a recipe page, here we go!</strong></p>
    <p>First you need to make a sourdough starter
        <ol>
            <li>Start with a clean and clear jar</li>
            <li>Put in 30g of lukewarm water and 30g of flour (I used rye since it is supposed to be easier to handle)</li>
            <li>Now mix very well</li>
            <li>Cover the jar but not airtight</li>
            <li>Let that sit for 24 hours at a warm place</li>
            <li>Now for the next 4-5 days take away 30g from the sourdough and feed it again with 30g of flour and 30g of water. By day 3 your sourdough should be starting to build bubbles and double in size. 
                <strong>Don't worry if it smells weird!</strong> It is normal for the sourdough starter to smell weird alcoholic/sour in the beginning. Usually the smell should settle to a nice yeasty dough smell by day 5.
                <strong>But:</strong> if it smells like nail polish remover or you can see mold or a rose/orange liquid on top, throw it away and start again!
            </li>            
        </ol>
        <p>Great how you should have something that looks like this:</p>

    </p>
    <p>Alright now we can start making bread. My first one was a 50/50 wheat/rye flour sourdough bread</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Take 30g of your sourdough starter and mix it with 100g of water and 100g flour</li>
        <li>Let that sit for about 12 hours. sometimes it is less sometimes it is more. When it has doubled in size you can use it</li>
        <li> Now take mix all these ingredients together:
            <ul>
                <li>the sourdough starter</li>
                <li>250g rye flour</li>
                <li>250g wheat flour</li>
                <li>350g water</li>
                <li>12g salt</li>
            </ul>
            It will be very <em>sticky</em> because of the rye!
            <p>Mine looked like this:</p>
            <img src="../images/dough.JPEG" alt="sticky dough" height="400" width="250">
        </li>
        <li>Let the dough sit for the bulk fermantation. I did it overnight in the fridge as this is supposed to make your bread more aromatic but if you are impatient 1 hour in the warmth should do it as well</li>
        <li>Shape your bread and put it in your baking dish of choice</li>
        <img src="../images/shapedBread.JPG" alt="shaped bread" height="400" width="200">
        <li>Preheat your oven to 250°C and add a bowl of water so ther is steam</li>
        <li>Now bake your bread for 10 minutes with the steam</li>
        <li>Remove the water bowl and lower the temperatur to 200°C</li>
        <li>Finish baking your bread 45-50 minutes</li>
        <img src="../images/finishedBread.JPG" alt="baked sourdough bread" height="400" width="200">
        <li>Let it cool down for 12-18 Hours</li>
        <li>Last but not least: <strong>Enjoy!!!</strong></li>
    </ol>
